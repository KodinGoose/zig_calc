# zig_calc
A very simple terminal based calculator made in Zig. 

Currently only does addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), modulo(%) and powers(^)
The inputed numbers must be positive and must be integers.

Example equations:  5 * 5 + 5 = 30; 5 + 5 * 5 = 50
Whitespace is ignored. Type 'q' into an equation to exit the program.

Additional features planed in the future.
This is my first project in Zig and my first program where I didn't spend 80% of my time debugging.
