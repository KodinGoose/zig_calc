# zig_calc
A very simple terminal based calculator made in Zig. 
Currently only does addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and the inputed numbers must be positive.
Additional features planed in the future.
This is my first project in Zig and my first program where I didn't spend 80% of my time debugging.
