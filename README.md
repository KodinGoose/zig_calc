# zig_calc
A very simple terminal based calculator made in Zig. 

Currently only does addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), modulo(%), powers(^) and square root(_)
The inputed numbers must be positive and must be integers. The biggest number this program can handle is 2^512/2-1 and the smallest number is 2^512/(-2)

Example equations:  5 * 5 + 5 = 30, 5 + 5 * 5 = 50, 5 + (5 * _16 - (5 + 2)) = 18
Whitespace is ignored. Type 'q' into an equation to exit the program.

This is my first project in Zig and my first program where I didn't spend 80% of my time debugging.
